## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I grew up watching hockey, and I still love it to this day. I always wondered how the hockey hosts could make predictions about the game outcome. As I got older, I started to understand that stats played a big part in that. It would be nice to be able to make accurate predictions of my own in pools, and just in general. How many faceoffs lead to goals? This is the topic I am interested in. Having a strong core of centers makes a huge difference in a game. But how can you quantify that faceoff wins translate to goals? Normally I would try to look this sort of thing up on the internet, where someone else has done the work. Searching for answers, is much different than creating them. Searching only leads to more questions. Are they correct? How did they arrive at this conclusion? What data did they use? Are the people who conducted this search trustworthy? I will sidestep around this minefield by creating the answer myself, and presenting it in a dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data I chose is composed of hockey stats, plays.csv. Stats of continuous plays, from whistle to whistle are contained in this dataset in the form of a table. This means that play related events in a game are contained in this table, making it a large dataset. The data was collected by the NHL, and scraped by Martin Ellis using an API created by Kevin Sidwar. Ellis' intent is to "assess what and how much individual actions contribute to the outcome of the game". The data is from the 2012-2013 to 2018-2019 season. There is some missing data, it does not include relocated teams, and expansion teams. Some data is irrelevant, so cleaning it up will be something that I will have to do. I will use this dataset to assess the time between a faceoff and a goal. There are a few more datasets that relate to plays.csv in the repository where I found it. They may be useful for crossreferncing a team's total number of faceoffs, to total number of goals in a season. This dataset was approved by my TA, Roozbeh.
